/ TD8E 18-bit DECtape DUMP Program.  Based on DUMPREST code from D. Gesswein
/ (see ftp://ftp.pdp8online.com/software/dumprest).
/ Modified for 18-bit DECtape w/standard checksum imaging by J. Dersch
/
/ This program will send a DECtape image out the console port.
/ The format of the data sent is 0xff (0377) or 0xfd if read error
/ followed by 384 12-bit words (256 18-bit words) of data for each block.
/ After the last block a 0xfe (0376) is sent
/ with a two byte checksum, low 8 bits first then upper 4.
/ The words in a block are sent as three bytes for each 2 words.
/   1 = low 8 bits first word
/   2 = upper 4 bits first and lower 4 bits second
/   3 = upper 8 bits second word
/
/ The program (PC) receiving the data should be started before this program.
/
/ To run, start at 0200.
/    SR 11 should be drive, only 0 and 1 supported without reassembling
/    SR 6-8 should be maximum memory field in computer, needs 8k minimum
/
/ The receiving program should be running first.
/ At normal exit hitting cont will restart the program.
/
/ Should halt at label finish (140) with number of recoverable errors in AC
/ The current block being read will be displayed in the AC
/ while running.
/
/ The PC program will print out the bad location if an error occurs.
/
/ We will retry each read up to four times on error.
/
/ This transfers the standard 256 word by 578 blocks used by 18-bit DEC hardware,
/ using standard checksums (as used by the PDP-9 and later machines).
/ It will read as many blocks are present up to the forward end-zone, so it will
/ handle tapes that vary from the standard 1102(8) block length.

/ABSTRACT--
/       THE ROUTINE DESCRIBED AND LISTED HERE IS A GENERAL
/DATA HANDLER FOR THE TD8E DECTAPE SYSTEM. THE ROUTINE
/CONTAINS SEARCH, READ, AND WRITE FUNCTIONS IN A FORMAT
/WHICH IS COMPATIBLE WITH OS/8 DEVICE HANDLER CALLING
/SEQUENCES.

/FIXES SINCE FIELD-TEST RELEASE:

/1.     FIXED BUG RE CLA ON RETRY AFTER ERROR
/2.     ALLOWED FINAL BOOTSTRAP TO BE INTO A WRITE-LOCKED DEVICE

/OS/8 V3D CHANGES:

/3.     FIXED BUG RE TD8E BUILD (V6B PATCH)

/THIS ROUTINE CAN BE RE-EDITED AND ASSEMBLED TO PRODUCE
/VARIATIONS ON THE BASIC TD8E SYSTEM. ASSEMBLY PARAMETERS
/CONTROL:
/A) WHAT DRIVES (UNITS 0-7) WILL BE USED
/B) THE ORIGIN OF THE TWO PAGE ROUTINE
/C) WHAT MEMORY FIELD THE ROUTINE WILL RUN IN
/D) THE SIZE OF THE DECTAPE BLOCK TO BE READ/WRITTEN

/FOLLOWING ARE THE PARAMETERS SET UP FOR THE STANDARD
/DEC VERSION OF THIS ROUTINE:

        DRIVE=10        /UNITS 0 AND 1 SELECTED
        ORIGIN=600      /ENTER AT ORIGIN, ORIGIN+4
        AFIELD=0        /INITIAL FIELD SETTING
        MFIELD=00       /AFIELD*10=MFIELD
        WDSBLK=600      /384 12-BIT WORDS PER BLOCK (256 18-BIT DATA WORDS)

/THE USE OF THE PARAMETERS IS AS FOLLOWS:

/ DRIVE: DRIVE DETERMINES WHICH UNITS WILL BE SELECTED
/       DRIVE=10 IMPLIES UNITS 0 &1
/       DRIVE=20 IMPLIES UNITS 2&3
/       DRIVE=30 IMPLIES UNITS 4&5
/       DRIVE=40 IMPLIES UNITS 6&7

/ORIGIN: ALTERING ORIGIN CAUSES ASSEMBLY IN A DIFFERENT
/       MEMORY LOCATION. WHEN CHANGING ORIGIN KEEP IN MIND
/THAT THIS IS A TWO PAGE ROUTINE.

/AFIELD: AFIELD DETERMINES THE INITIAL FIELD SETTING FOR THE
/       LOADER. PERMISSIBLE VALUES FOR AFIELD ARE 0 TO 7.

/MFIELD: MFIELD IS USED IN A CIF CDF MFIELD INSTRUCTION.
/       THE VALUE INSERTED FOR MFIELD SHOULD BE 10(8) TIMES
/       THE VALUE FOR AFIELD. THE PERMISSIBLE VALUES ARE 00-70.

/WDSBLK: WDSBLK GOVERNS HOW MANY WORDS THE ROUTINE THINKS ARE
/       IN A DECTAPE BLOCK. THE STANDARD VALUE IS 201(8) OR
/       128 DECIMAL. NOTE THAT THE FUNCTION WORD BIT 10 CAN
/ 129 DECIMAL ??? (DJG)
/       BE USED TO SUBTRACT ONE FROM WDSBLK. THE VALUE USED
/       FOR WDSBLK SHOULD BE THE NUMBER OF WORDS THE TAPE WAS
/       FORMATTED TO CONTAIN.

/IF WE WANT A HANDLER FOR UNITS 2&3 TO RESIDE IN
/FIELD 2 AT LOCATION 3000 AND READ/WRITE 256(10) WORDS
/PER BLOCK, THE PARAMETERS WOULD BE:
/       DRIVE=20
/       ORIGIN=3000
/       AFIELD=2
/       MFIELD=20
/       WDSBLK=400
/THE CALL TO THE SUBROUTINE FOLLOWS BASICALLY THE
/CALLING SEQUENCE FOR OS/8 DEVICE HANDLERS.
/THE CALLING SEQUENCE IS:

/       CDF CURRENT
/       CIF MFIELD      /MFIELD=FIELD ASSEMBLED IN
/       JMS ENTRY       /ENTRY=ORIGIN (EVEN NUMBERED DRIVE
                        /AND ORIGIN+4 FOR ODD NUMBERED DRIVE.
/       ARG1
/       ARG1B (DJG)
/       ARG2
/       ARG3
/       ERROR RETURN
/       NORMAL RETURN

/THE ARGUMENTS ARE:

/ARG1: FUNCTION WORD    BIT0: 0=READ, 1=WRITE
/                       BITS 1-5: UNUSED, WAS # BLOCKS IN OPERATION (DJG)
/                       BITS 6-8: FIELD OF BUFFER AREA
/                       BIT 9: UNUSED
/                       BIT 10: # OF WORDS/BLOCK.
/                       0= WDSBLK, 1=WDSBLK-1
/                       BIT 11: 1=START FORWARD, 0=REVERSE
/ARG1A: # OF BLOCKS IN OPERATIONA (DJG)
/ARG2: BUFFER ADDRESS FOR OPERATION
/ARG3: STARTING BLOCK FOR OPERATION

/ERRORS: THE HANDLER DETECTS TWO TYPES OF ERRORS:
/A) FATAL ERRORS- PARITY ERROR, TIMING ERROR,
/               TOO GREAT A BLOCK NUMBER
/       FATAL ERRORS TAKE ERROR RETURN WITH THE
/       AC=4000.
/B) NON-FATAL- SELECT ERROR.
/       IF NO PROPER UNIT IS SELECTED, THE ERROR
/       RETURN IS TAKEN WITH CLEAR AC.
/FATAL ERRORS TRY THREE TIMES BEFORE TAKING ERROR RETURN.
/THE NORMAL RETURN IS TAKEN AFTER ALL INDICATED
/BLOCKS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. THE AC IS CLEAR.

/THE TD8E IOT'S ARE:
        SDSS=7001-DRIVE /SKIP ON SINGLE LINE FLAG
        SDST=7002-DRIVE /SKIP ON TIMING ERROR
        SDSQ=7003-DRIVE /SKIP ON QUAD LINE FLAG
        SDLC=7004-DRIVE /LOAD COMMAND REGISTER
        SDLD=7005-DRIVE /LOAD DATA REGISTER
        SDRC=7006-DRIVE /READ COMMAND REGISTER
        SDRD=7007-DRIVE /READ DATA REGISTER

/THE IOT'S IN GENERAL ARE 677X,676X,675X,AND 674X.
/THE OTHERS CONTROL UNITS 2-7.

/       THIS HANDLER USES DECTAPE BLOCKS NOT OS/8 BLOCKS !
